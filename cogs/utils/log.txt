Simple python discord bot that has useful features! Themed around Clash Royale and made by verix.

## Requirements
This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance.
You need the following to run the bot:
```
python 3.5+
discord.py
```
## Setup
Open a terminal in the directory of the bots location and type
```
$ python3 bot.py
```
On first start the launcher will run and you will need to input data.

After that the bot will launch without setup neccessary.

## Commands

The default set of modules includes:
* Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/mute, mod-log, chat cleanup)
* Fun misc commands.
* Utility commands such as logs and tags
* Complex Embed commands
* Custom commands
